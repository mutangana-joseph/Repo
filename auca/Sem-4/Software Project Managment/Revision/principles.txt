How to keep them without pain (this works)
1️⃣ For PMI Principles (12)

You don’t need long sentences. Just keywords.

Think in buckets:

Value

Stakeholders

Leadership

Team

Quality

Complexity

Risk / Uncertainty

Adaptability

Tailoring

Systems thinking

If you can recall keywords, you can “state” them.

Self-organizing teams

Continuous improvement
