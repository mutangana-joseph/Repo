                                                                        ====================

System Model: Is an abstract representation of the system project. It contains Context model and behavior model.
---

Context model: Shows a system with it's subsystem without their functionality or behavior of the system.
---

Behavior Model: Shows the behavior of the system under application of external events.
--------------- Shows the dynamic, characteristics, and functionality of the system.

Behavior model contains: 1. Data flow model 
------------------------ 2. State model: Shows behave of machine under application events. 

Data model: It's a model representing a system with a huge of amount of data(big data).
---

Big data contains 5 Vs: 1. Volume : Amount data are being produced.
----------------------- 2. Velocity: Data are generated with high speed.
                        3. Variety : Different types of data, (Structured and unstructured data).
                        4. Veracity: Reliability and authenticity of data.
                        5. Value : usefulness of the data. Our data has a value.

                                                                       ====================

UML Stands for "Unified Modeling Language": It is an industry-standard graphical language for specifying, visualizing, contracting, and document the artfacts of software system.

UML Modeling contains  -Structural: Static features
                       -Behavioral: dynamic feature
                       -Architectural: Blue print feature of entire system

                                                              **-----------------------------------**




Requirements Contains; what, focus, perspective.
---

What: defines what system needs todo.
Focus: user needs, functionality, performance ,and characteristics
Perspective: written from user or stakeholders


Specification Contains: How, focus, perspective.
---

How: provide detailed, technical description of how requirements will be met
Focus: Technical details, materials dimension, interfaces and design
Perspective: written from engineering or implementation.

Verification: "Are we building the product right" Checks if product is being built correctly according to its specification.
---
Validation:  "Are we building the right product" Software should do what user really required.
---


                                                                         V & V process
                                                                  -----------------------------

Each step in building a product, contains verification and validation

V & V Goal
----------
To build a product without defect
It doesn't mean that the product will be 100% correct.

V & V Confidence:
--------------
Software Function
User expectation



Static & Dynamic Verification
-----------------------------

Static : Analysis the code without executing it
Dynamic:


Software Inspections(Static verification)
Software Testing: Concern with exercising and observing product behavior(Dynamic verification)
