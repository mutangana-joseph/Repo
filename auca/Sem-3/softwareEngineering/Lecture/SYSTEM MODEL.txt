                                  SYSTEM MODEL
                              ====================

System Model: Is an abstract representation of the system project. It contains Context model and behavior model.
-------------

Context model: Shows a system with it's subsystem without their functionality or behavior of the system.
--------------

Behavior Model: Shows the behavior of the system under application of external events.
--------------- Shows the dynamic, characteristics, and functionality of the system.

Behavior model contains: 1. Data flow model
------------------------ 2. State model: Shows behave of machine under application events.

Data model: It's a model representing a system with a huge of amount of data(big data).
-----------

Big data contains 5 Vs: 1. Volume : Amount data are being produced.
----------------------- 2. Velocity: Data are generated with high speed.
                        3. Variety : Different types of data, (Structured and unstructured data).
                        4. Veracity: Reliability and authenticity of data.
                        5. Value : usefulness of the data. Our data has a value.

                              ====================

UML Stands for "Unified Modeling Language": It is an industry-standard graphical language for specifying, visualizing, contracting, and document the artfacts of software system.

UML Modeling contains  -Structural: Static features
                       -Behavioral: dynamic feature
                       -Architectural: Blue print feature of entire system
